    <div class="lyrics">[VERSE 1]<br>
        Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots<br>
        And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly<br>
        She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit<br>
        And when she needs to shelter from reality<br>
        She takes a dip in my daydreams<br>
</div>


<div class="lyrics2">[CHORUS]<br>
    My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind<br>
    That little lady sittin' on the passenger side<br>
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light<br>
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes<br>
As Arabella, oh<br>
As Arabella<br></div>

<div class="lyrics3">[POST-CHORUS]<br>
    Just might've tapped into your mind and soul<br>
    You can't be sure<br></div>


<div class="lyrics4">[VERSE 2]<br>
    Arabella's got a '70s head<br>
    But she's a modern lover, it's an exploration<br>
    She's made of outer space<br>
    And her lips are like the galaxy's edge<br>
    And her kiss the colour of a constellation<br>
    Fallin' into place<br>

<div class="lyrics5">[CHORUS]<br>
    My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind<br>
    That little lady sittin' on the passenger side<br>
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light<br>
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes<br>
As Arabella, oh<br>
As Arabella<br></div>

<div class="lyrics6">[POST-CHORUS]<br>
    Just might've tapped into your mind and soul<br>
    You can't be sure<br></div>

<div class="lyrics7">[BRIDGE]<br>
    (That's magic) In a cheetah print coat<br>
    (Just a slip) Underneath it, I hope<br>
    (Asking if) I can have one of those<br>
    (Organic) Cigarettes that she smokes<br>
    (Wraps her lips) 'Round a Mexican Coke<br>
    (Makes you wish) That you were the bottle<br>
    (Takes a sip) Of your soul, and it sounds like<br></div>
    

    <div class="lyrics8">[OUTRO]<br>
        Just might've tapped into your mind and soul<br>
        You can't be sure<br></div>
